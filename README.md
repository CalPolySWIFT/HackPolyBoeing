Hi all! This is the place where you will be able to find all files related to this competition.

Feel free to contact jennapham@cpp.edu if you have any questions.

**FAQ:**

Q: What devices will we be using?

>A: Your team is expected to use a mobile device (specifically something small like a phone) that runs iOS or Android.

Q: Which version of iOS/Android should I be developing my application for?

>A: Any version you prefer. There is no requried version.

Q: Will I be given a physical device to test my application?

>A: Yes, only if you are developing an Android app. If you are developing on iOS app then you will need to test it using your own device. **We are still waiting to receive the devices from the bookstore. Once they arrive you will be notified immediately.**

Q: Do I need to register for Tech Symposium?

>A: No. Someone from the SWIFT E-Board has already registered you.

Q: Do I need to be present at Tech Symposium?

>A: Yes the ENTIRE team must be present for the during of the competition. The exact times will be announced at a later date.

Q: Will we be given a data set to train our object detection model or do we have to somehow get it ourselves?

>A: We are going to generate a few snapshots from 3D CAD models but it wonâ€™t produce a large enough sample to train a CNN model. I suggest that the students use data augmentation to generate similar images from what we provide to increase their sample size.

Q: It was mentioned that there would be stickers placed on the part and we would have to determine the coordinates of the sticker (relative the origin point that Boeing will set) and piece the sticker is on. What kind of stickers are these?

>A: These stickers are simply markers - they do not contain a QR code or anything of the like.
