**FAQ:**

Q: What devices will we be using?

>A: Your team is expected to use a mobile device (specifically something small like a phone) that runs iOS or Android.

Q: Which version of iOS/Android should I be developing my application for?

>A: Any version you prefer. There is no requried version.

Q: Will I be given a physical device to test my application?

>A: Yes, only if you are developing an Android app. If you are developing on iOS app then you will need to test it using your own device.

Q: Will we be given a data set to train our object detection model or do we have to somehow get it ourselves?

>A: We are going to generate a few snapshots from 3D CAD models but it wonâ€™t produce a large enough sample to train a CNN model. I suggest that the students use data augmentation to generate similar images from what we provide to increase their sample size.
